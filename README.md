    Four 100 scores and PWA ready. Just connect your data.

This is not a template. This is a complete application, built on top of React, with all tiny details taken care of so you just need to bring the data to feed it.

Accessibility is a priority in my projects and I think it should be in yours too, so this was developed listening to real screen readers, focus traps and keyboard navigation are available everywhere.

This is a Typescript version of the popular windmill-dashboard-react. It works the exact same way. You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/estevanmaito/windmill-dashboard-react)
